Using the Eorzean time formula to create handy timers for gathering nuts.

## Issues & Feature Requests

Please submit them to the issues section of this repo. Keep in mind I am a real human with a job, and disrespectful comments & demands will be ignored.
Thanks for your kind support and appreciation for this project.


## Development Setup
`npm install`
`npm start`

## Testing

There is a jasmine specrunner set up at `/test/SpecRunner.html`. Be sure to write any tests for data logic where needed.
Views should always be simple enough to need minimal testing, and instead rely on data changes to render.


## Contributing

1. Write any passing tests as needed!
2. Submit a pull request, detailing at length the changes you have made. Screenshots are also very helpful when I am testing your PR code.
