        <h3 className="bordered-header">F.A.Q</h3>

        <h4>The time seems off by ~3 Eorzean minutes. What's up with that?</h4>
        <p>Eorzean time is calculated from Epoch time -- one hour is 2 minutes, 55 seconds Earth time. Because of this, sometimes the math that rounds the time up or down can be off by about 30 seconds.</p>
        <p>
          If your time is off by much more than 3 minutes, your computer/phone's time may be off.
          Check out <a href="http://time.is/" target="_blank"> http://time.is/ </a>
          to see if it's a time sync issue.</p>

        <h4>There's a bunch of other timers out there. Why make another one?</h4>
        <p>A few reasons, actually!</p>
        <ul className="browser-default">
          <li>I'm a web developer + huge gathering crazie. I wanted to build something that was exactly what I wanted as I spend a LOT of time gathering and staring at this timer screen. :)</li>
          <li>There isn't an open-source project for timers. I'd rather share my work and hope others help make it better.</li>
          <li>I frankly didn't like the look/feel or features of what exists currently!</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          I think it's great that there are lots of options, and I encourage you to
          <i>not</i> use mine if it doesn't work for you. :)
        </p>

        <h4>Can you add [insert feature here]?</h4>

        <p>Probably! Please make an suggestion as an issue on the github repo
          <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/tnbKristi/eorzea_timers"> here</a>!</p>
